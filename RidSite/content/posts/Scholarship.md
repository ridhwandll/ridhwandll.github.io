Got a dream down today, finally. I lowkey expected talentpool, which started from 1190(approximately), I got 1184 :)

<br>

But hey, 048th in general in not bad, 1st from Joseph EV ✌️

<br>

I shouldn't be content with this, but I am happy because I achieved all these 100% by myself, had none to help around me during exams, I was the G there.

<br>

Guess I should write more stuff here instead of threads, that thing sucks
