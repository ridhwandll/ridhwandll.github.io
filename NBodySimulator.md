## Overview

The N-body problem asks: given N masses in space, each attracting every other through Newtonian gravity, how do they move over time? For two bodies this has an exact analytical solution. For three or more it generally does not — the only way to study it is through numerical simulation.

This simulator computes pairwise gravitational forces between all N bodies simultaneously using vectorized MATLAB matrix operations, integrates their motion using the symplectic Velocity Verlet method, and visualizes the result in real time with trail rendering, energy monitoring, and collision detection.

## Features

### Physics
- **O(N²) all-pairs gravitational force computation** using fully vectorized N×N matrix operations — no explicit loops
- **Velocity Verlet integration** — symplectic integrator that conserves energy over long runs, unlike Euler or RK4
- **Softening parameter ε** — prevents singularities during close encounters by smoothing the gravitational potential
- **Elastic and inelastic collision detection** using impulse-based resolution with configurable restitution coefficient

### Visualization
- Real-time body rendering using MATLAB rectangle objects with mass-proportional sizing
- **Gradient trail system** showing orbital history for each body
- **Dynamic star field** that rescales with the camera zoom
- **Soft color palette** using HSV color model at reduced saturation for comfortable viewing
- Auto-zooming camera that keeps all bodies in frame at all times

### Energy Monitor
- Live plot of **Kinetic Energy (KE)**, **Potential Energy (PE)**, and **Total Energy (TE)**
- Flat total energy line confirms integrator accuracy
- Spikes in KE/PE during close encounters with conservation of total energy visible in real time

### UI
- 16 simulation presets with per-preset auto-configuration of G, dt, steps/tick, and radius
- **Auto-Configure** checkbox — locks optimal parameters per preset or allows manual override
- Configurable: gravitational constant, timestep, steps per tick, body count, collision mode, trail toggle, star toggle
- Real-time stats display: simulation time, step count, FPS
- Preset descriptions explaining the physics of each configuration
- Welcome screen on launch
- Button press sound feedback

### Export
- Record simulation to `.mp4` video file with configurable FPS and quality presets
- Smooth camera tracking reproduced in exported video
- ESC to cancel mid-export
- Estimated time remaining display during export

## Physics

### Gravitational Acceleration Kernel

For each body i, the net gravitational acceleration from all other bodies j is:

```
aᵢ = Σⱼ  G · mⱼ · (rⱼ - rᵢ) / |rⱼ - rᵢ|³
```

Computed as fully vectorized N×N matrix operations:

```matlab
dx    = pos(:,1)' - pos(:,1);          % N×N pairwise x-distances
dy    = pos(:,2)' - pos(:,2);          % N×N pairwise y-distances
r2    = dx.^2 + dy.^2 + e2;            % squared distance + softening
invR3 = r2.^(-1.5);                    % 1/r³ — no sqrt needed
invR3(1:N+1:end) = 0;                  % zero diagonal (no self-force)
fac   = G * (m') .* invR3;             % gravitational factor per pair
acc   = [sum(fac.*dx, 2), ...          % net acceleration per body
         sum(fac.*dy, 2)];
```

### Velocity Verlet Integration (Kick-Drift-Kick)

```
a₁      = acc(pos(t))                  % acceleration at current position
v(t+dt/2) = v(t) + a₁ · dt/2          % half kick
pos(t+dt) = pos(t) + v(t+dt/2) · dt   % full drift
a₂      = acc(pos(t+dt))              % acceleration at new position
v(t+dt) = v(t+dt/2) + a₂ · dt/2       % half kick
```

This is a **symplectic integrator** — it preserves a shadow Hamiltonian, keeping total energy bounded rather than drifting unboundedly as with Euler integration.

### Energy Computation

```
KE = Σᵢ  ½ · mᵢ · |vᵢ|²

PE = Σᵢ Σⱼ₍ⱼ₎ᵢ  -G · mᵢ · mⱼ / rᵢⱼ

TE = KE + PE  (should remain constant)
```

### Collision Resolution

Impulse-based collision response:

```
J = -(1 + e) · (v_rel · n̂) / (1/m₁ + 1/m₂)

v₁' = v₁ + (J/m₁) · n̂
v₂' = v₂ - (J/m₂) · n̂
```

Where `e` is the restitution coefficient: `e=1` (elastic, energy conserved), `e=0.4` (inelastic, energy lost).

## Known Limitations

- The physics engine is O(N²) — performance degrades significantly above N=30 bodies
- Choreographic presets (Figure 8, Yarn, Broucke, Butterfly) are sensitive to timestep — changing dt while Auto-Configure is off will break the orbit
- Collision detection uses circular approximation — works best with equal-mass bodies
- Exported video frame rate is limited by render speed — very complex simulations may produce lower effective FPS than specified
- Simulation time `T` is in dimensionless simulation units, not real seconds
